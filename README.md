I have often wished more apps utilized a split view while displaying in
landscape on the iPhone/iPod Touch. Now with the iPhone 5 arriving, a split
view makes even more sense. This project is an example of what the
interface might look like. The project contains a basic UITableView for the
master view, which when selected focuses on the detail view, UIScrollView.
The focus can be put back on the master view, by swiping on the table view 
which stays on the left hand side of the screen.

This project, should be compatable with iOS 4.3+ as I chose not to use 
multiple UIViewControllers. Multiple UIViewControllers would simplify the
design as more interaction is needed between the master and detail, but
this is just for an example.
